# Hitch a Ride
Hitch a Ride is an easy to use web app designed to help people carpool to/from my wedding. It was first developed as a Front-End capstone project while studying at Nashville Software School.  

## Introduction

My Fiance and I are planning our wedding and the venue we chose is in a pretty rural area. Lyft and Uber do go out there, but the hotels don't have any shuttles and providing transportation was out of our price range. I wanted to help our guests get to the venue in a way that limited the number of people needing to drive and minimized the cost if they wanted to use a ride-sharing service.

## Logging in

When a user logs in for the first time, they will be asked to input their contact information. Users will then see a list of other guests using the app and are able to browse for rides.



- Users need to be able to log in and create an account
- Users need to be able to add information to their profile
	- Name
	- Contact info
	- Where they're staying
	- Looking for or providing rides
	- Willing to split a Lyft/Uber?
- Users will be presented with a list of other attendees which can be sorted/filtered
- Users need to be able to contact other attendees either through the app or through their provided contact info

Stretch:
Possibly integrate Lyft/Uber APIs for ride cost estimation and/or ride requesting

# Default Docs

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
